========================================================
-I'm trying to make an entire megaman level from scratch! I have until the 1st of december 2019.
 So far I've made some platforms, and the physics of megaman.

-Unfortunately I can't publish the images and audio needed to run the game incase I get in trouble.
 So if you want to give it a try then email me (direin13@gmail.com). I'll send them asap!
 Of course you can still look at the code anytime though

-If you have the images and audio then open 'testing_megaman.py' to see the results so far.

-Feedback and criticism is much appreciated!
