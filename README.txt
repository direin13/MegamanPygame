========================================================
A Megaman level from scratch using my first game engine (if you can call it that) built.

-Run 'Game.exe' to play.

-Controls:
	  right = rightArrow
	  left = leftArrow
	  up = upArrow
	  down = downArrow
	  shoot = z
	  jump = x
	  pause/unpause = p/o

- n.b Made on Windows 10. I have not tested on linux although Game.py should still run.

Made with python 3.7.3 and pygame 1.9.6
Made as a personal educational project in college for non-profit. IT SHOULD NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED FOR PROFIT!!
