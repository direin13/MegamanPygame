-I'm trying to make an entire megaman level from scratch! I have until the 1st of december 2019.
 So far I've made some platforms, the physics of megaman, shooting and a camera.

-Open 'game.py' to see the results so far.

-controls(right = rightArrow
	  left = leftArrow
	  up = upArrow
	  down = downArrow
	  action = z
	  jump = x)

-Feedback and criticism is much appreciated!
